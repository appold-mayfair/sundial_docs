\chapter{Design and implementation considerations}
\label{h:design-implementation-considerations}

This appendix chapter describes some considerations that we have taken into account while designing and implementing the Midgard protocol.

\notebox{It may be a good idea to move rationales out of the main chapters and into this appendix.
  Those chapters can focus on the "How?" of Midgard (useful for devs), while this appendix provide the "Why?" for architects and analysts.

  If this appendix chapter grows too big, we may eventually spin it out into separate "Design specification" and "Implementation guide" documents.}
