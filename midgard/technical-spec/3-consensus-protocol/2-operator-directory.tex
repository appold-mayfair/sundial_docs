\section{Operator directory}
\label{h:operator-directory}

Midgard operators receive and process L2 events from users, collate them into blocks, publish the full block contents on the data availability layer, and commit the block headers to Midgard's state queue on L1.
This responsibility is shared among the operators on a rotating schedule, with each operator getting a turn to exclusively process L2 events and then commit their block of events at the end of their turn.

Anyone can register to become a Midgard operator if they post the required ADA bond.
Registrants must wait a prescribed period of time before they activate as an operator.
An active operator can retire to remove themself from the rotating schedule.
Retired operators must wait until all their committed block headers mature before recovering their ADA bond.

An operator's ADA bond collateralizes their promise to faithfully process L2 events and commit valid blocks to L1.
If an operator's block header is proven to be fraudulent, then the operator is disqualified and forfeits their bond.
Similarly, an operator that submits duplicate registrations forfeits the bonds placed in the duplicates.

Every forfeited bond is split into a reward paid to the fraud prover and a slashing penalty paid (via transaction fees) to the Cardano treasury.
Among the Midgard protocol parameters, the \code{fraud\_prover\_reward} and \code{slashing\_penalty} parameters must sum up to the \code{required\_bond} parameter.

\subsection{Utxo representation}
\label{h:operator-directory-utxo-representation}

The Operator Directory keeps track of all Midgard operators and stores their bond deposits.
It separates operators into three groups based on their status, with every group using operators' public key hashes (PKHs) as keys:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{registered\_operators} is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue that tracks operators who have posted their ADA bonds and are waiting to activate.
      It is implemented as a key-unordered linked list (see \cref{h:key-unordered-list}), where each new registrant is prepended to the beginning of the list.
      This means that the earliest registrant to become eligible for activation is always at the last node of the list.
    \item \code{active\_operators} is a set that tracks active operators participating in the rotating schedule, implemented as a key-ordered linked list (see \cref{h:key-ordered-list}).
    \item \code{retired\_operators} is a set that tracks retired operators waiting to recover their ADA bonds, implemented as a key-ordered linked list.
\end{itemize}

The Operator Directory keeps track of the activation time of every registered operator, which indicates when the operator will become eligible for activation.
It also keeps track of any holds on the ADA bonds of active and retired operators, which prevent those operators from recovering their bonds until their latest committed blocks and latest settlement resolution claims mature.
\begin{align*}
    \T{RegisteredOperator} &\coloneq \Bigl( \T{activation\_time}: \T{PosixTime} \Bigr) \\
    \T{ActiveOperator}     &\coloneq \Bigl( \T{bond\_unlock\_time}:
        \T{Option}(\T{PosixTime}) \Bigr) \\
    \T{RetiredOperator}    &\coloneq \Bigl( \T{bond\_unlock\_time}:
        \T{Option}(\T{PosixTime}) \Bigr)
\end{align*}

The above are app-specific types for the \code{data} field of their respective lists' \code{NodeDatum}.
For example, the \code{NodeDatum} of \code{registered\_operators} is:
\begin{equation*}
    \T{RegisteredOperatorDatum} \coloneq \T{NodeDatum} (\T{RegisteredOperator})
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Registered operators}
\label{h:registered-operators}

The \code{registered\_operators} queue keeps track of operators after registering and before activating or de-registering them.

\subsubsection{Minting policy}
\label{h:registered-operators-minting-policy}

The \code{registered\_operators} minting policy implements state transitions for its key-unordered linked list.

      Do \emph{not} return the duplicate node's ADA bond to its operator.

            \item Let \code{witness\_status} be one of: \code{Registered}, \code{Active}, or \code{Retired}.
            \item If \code{witness\_status} is \code{Registered}:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item The transaction must include a reference input of a \code{registered\_operators} node that proves the \code{duplicate\_node} key's membership in that list.

                \end{enumerate}

    The submitter of the Remove Duplicate Slash Bond transaction is considered to be the fraud prover, so the conditions for that redeemer do not need to explicitly enforce that the \code{fraud\_prover\_reward} is paid out because the submitter consents to the transaction.

        The state queue's onchain code is responsible for paying out the fraud prover's reward from the operator's forfeited ADA bond.
    \item[Remove Operator Bad Settlement.] Remove an operator's node from the \code{retired\_operators} set without returning the operator's ADA bond to the operator, as a consequence of attaching a fraudulent resolution claim to the settlement queue.
      Conditions:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Let \code{slashed\_operator} be a redeemer argument indicating the operator being slashed.
            \item The transaction must Remove a node from the \code{retired\_operators} set.
              Let that node be \code{removed\_node}.
            \item \code{slashed\_operator} must match the key of \code{removed\_node}.
            \item The transaction fees must meet or exceed the \code{slashing\_penalty} protocol parameter, denominated in Lovelaces.
            \item The transaction must include the Midgard hub oracle NFT in a reference input.
            \item Let \code{settlement\_queue\_addr} be the address in the corresponding field of the Midgard hub oracle.
            \item The transaction must spend a node from the \code{settlement\_queue\_addr} via the Disprove Resolution Claim redeemer.
              The \code{fraudulent\_operator} argument provided to that redeemer must match \code{slashed\_operator}.
        \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Spending validator}
\label{h:retired-operators-spending-validator}

The spending validator of \code{retired\_operators\_addr} always forwards to its corresponding minting policy (statically parametrized) and requires the transaction to invoke it.
It does not allow any in-place modifications to the \code{RegisteredOperator} value of the node \code{data} field.
Conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The transaction must mint or burn tokens of the \code{retired\_operators} minting policy.
\end{enumerate}
