\chapter{Phase Two Validation}
\label{h:phase-two-validation}

Phase two validation represents the critical stage in Midgard's transaction processing where UPLC script evaluation occurs.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:phase-two-overview}

Phase two validation serves several key purposes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Validates the execution of UPLC scripts attached to transactions
    \item Ensures computational bounds are respected
    \item Maintains verifiable execution traces for fraud proof construction
    \item Enables efficient dispute resolution through progressive state hashing
\end{itemize}

The validation process consists of three main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item State representation and management
    \item Off-chain script decoding and preparation
    \item Execution validation and fraud proof mechanisms
\end{enumerate}

Each component is designed to maintain verifiability while optimizing for L2 performance constraints. The following sections detail these components and their interactions within the Midgard protocol.

\subsection{Validation Requirements}
\label{sec:validation-requirements}

For a transaction to pass phase two validation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All scripts must be successfully decoded from their byte representation
    \item Script execution must complete within specified resource bounds
    \item All state transitions must be cryptographically verifiable
    \item Execution traces must enable efficient fraud proof construction
\end{itemize}
